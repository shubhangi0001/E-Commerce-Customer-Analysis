## Description

This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, frequency distribution construction, visual representation using graphs and charts, summary statistics computation, and linear regression implementation.

## Dataset

### Rows and Columns

The dataset represents 5000 individual customer purchases with the following columns:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each purchased product.
- **Purchase Date**: Date and time when the purchase was made.
- **Price**: Price of the purchased product.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the purchased product.
- **Payment Method**: Method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, Debit Card, PayPal, etc.).
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer.
- **Product Category**: Category of the purchased product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books, etc.).
- **Product Description**: Description of the purchased product.
- **Shipping Address**: Address to which the product was shipped.
- **City**: City where the customer resides.
- **State**: State where the customer resides.
- **Country**: Country where the customer resides.
- **Discount Applied**: Any discount applied to the purchase (if applicable).
- **Order Status**: Status of the order (e.g., Delivered, Processing, Shipped, etc.).

## Steps

### Step 1: Create Dataset

- Gather and compile data from the e-commerce platform.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates.
- Handle outliers.
- Data normalization/standardization.

### Step 3: Construct Frequency Distributions

- Construction of Discrete and Continuous Frequency Distributions.

### Step 4: Visual Representation

- Use graphs and charts to visually represent the dataset:
  - Bar Diagram
  - Histogram
  - Pie Diagram
  - Frequency Curve
  - Frequency Polygon

### Step 5: Compute Summary Statistics

- Calculate the following summary statistics:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Range
  - Inter Quartile Range (IQR)
  - Standard Deviation
  - Variance

### Step 6: Compute Advanced Statistics

- Calculate advanced statistics:
  - Kurtosis
  - Skewness

### Step 7: Implement Linear Regression

- Apply linear regression to identify relationships between variables.
